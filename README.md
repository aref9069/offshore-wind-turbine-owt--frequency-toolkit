# offshore-wind-turbine-owt--frequency-toolkit
Open-source toolkit to compute offshore wind turbine (OWT) natural frequencies using both an analytical two-segment Eulerâ€“Bernoulli model (with axial load) and a 2-node EB FEM model with lumped/added mass and base springs. Includes side-by-side comparison tables, mesh convergence, sensitivity sweeps, and mode-shape overlays.
